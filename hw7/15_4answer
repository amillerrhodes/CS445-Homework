When the signal handler is removed, we can still tell that SIGPIPE is killing the parent process because of the following error message that results:

write error to pipe: Broken pipe
child closed pipe: Broken pipe

SIGPIPE is emitted when a process tries to write to a broken pipe. Therefore, when the error message tells us the pipe is broken, we can deduce that SIGPIPE was emitted to kill the parent process.
